 [The first 20 hours -- how to learn anything by Josh Kaufman at TEDxCSU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY) 

A great Ted talk.

Only takes 15 minutes to watch if speed it up to 1.5x. 

In the TED talk, Josh Kaufman talked about how the 10K hours rule is a social media lie and you can get reasonably good at a skill by 20 hours and how to do it.

It really speaks to a perfectionist like me, who procrastinate on learning new skills because I habitually set too high standards for myself and learning new things becomes scary. 

**My notes:**

**10K-hour rule VS 20-hour rule**

- "10K hours to be at the top of the field in a highly competitive field" (original study on athletes)--evolved to -- "10K hours to be an expert" --evolved to -- "10K hours rule to learn something". Suddenly the 10K rule is everywhere and demonized by social media.
- His research suggests it only took 20 hours to be reasonably good at a new skill.

**Here are the steps:**

- Deconstruct the skill
  - Break down skills into smaller pieces. Find the most essential sub-skills.
- Learn enough to self-correct
  - Get 3-5 study resources, just 3-5, don't procrastinate in piling up study resources, just get started.
  - Just learn enough to know if you are doing something wrong.
- Remove practice barriers
  - The major barrier to skill acquisition isn't intellectual, it's emotional. 
- Practice at least 20hours

**Example: Learn to play Ukulele**

- Get the instrument
- Find the most common cords
- Most songs just use those 4-5 cords
- Practice 20 hours.
- And you can play most of the pop songs in the past 50 years.
