Note from watching [The Goal of Meditation](https://youtu.be/E0JGS0ZEods) by [[Swami Sarvapriyananda]].

## The primary goal of meditation is enlightment
- Nowadays people embrace meditation because the stress reduction, heath effects. However, these are "perks" for doing meditation but not the mean goal.
- Mediation is introduced by marketing these main goals to get it popular first.
- "I give them what they want, so they will want what I want to give them." from a great monk.
- Mindfulness is the stepping stone for self-realization and enlightment.
- Meditation aims to cease the "modification of the mind", including thoughts, ideas, emotions and judgment. So we can witness our thought as it is.
- Mindfulness practice and Yogo or citing mantra works by reducing a million thought to one anchoring thought. From there, it's easier to reach "non wandering thought" status. 
- When you are thoughtless, you can truly appreciate your true self. An Analogy is you can not see the water if its wavy and get all muddy. 

## Disagreement between two schools
- There are two school of thought arguing if we can see the  "true witness of consciousness" with the presence of our thoughts. 
	- One school (Yoga or Yogi) believes you have to be thoughtless to see the true consciousness. The other school (Vedanda) believe the true consciousness is always there. 
	- An analogy would be: Can you see water during the day when all you can see is just reflection of external stuff like trees and flying birds? One school believe you have to get rid of all reflection to see the water itself. One school think the water is always there. 
-  Background info: Vedanta is a philosophy taught by the Vedas, the most ancient scriptures of India. Its basic teaching is that our real nature is divine. God, the underlying reality, exists in every being. Religion is therefore a search for self-knowledge, a search for the God within. (from wikiquote.org)
-  My thought: Theory-wise,I agree more with the Vedantic meditation. It's like the best way to understand a math theory is to do 20 problem sets that apply this theory, instead of reading and repeating the definition a thousand times.

## A cool technique mentioned to separate pure consciousness from mind
- In buddhism one of the terms used for this pure consciousness is the ''clear light of the void''.
- One of the techniques (vigna bhairava has 112 techniques of meditation) is as followed:
	-  You lie on the grass, relaxed, and stare at the bright blue sky so that you see only the bright blue sky.
	-  close your eyes and imagine, bring to your mind's eye the vast blue void, the shining blue sky , and nothing but the sky. 
	-  Intensely imagine it and in a moment, drop the sky. Just let go of the sky from your imagination. But keep the luminosity.
	-  Now what will happen is, if you try it intensely enough, it's a way of tricking the mind. Your intense imagination of luminous blue sky will suggest to the mind the pure consciousness. If you can somehow drop the concept of the sky from that, what is left over is the suggestion of luminosity pointing towards consciousness. 
	-  It's a great exercise to separate the "mind" (concept of sky) from "pure consciousness" (clear light of the void).
-  My thought: Practice wise, I also agree with vedantic meditation. I was confused about "focusing" practice in some mindfulness meditation, because "I have to not think about anything", for me, is a very powerful thought that is suppressing all other experience, including the feeling of enlightment. 

- The yoga technique is effortful. You need to focus on not thinking, sit and breathe in a particular way. But you only need to do it in the morning/evening for the duration of the practice. 
- The Vedanta approach is effortless. It only takes 1 second that you get the concept that your awareness is always there, interacting with external disturbance. But the practice requires constant engagement. (whenever you hear a noise, pay attention to it and think about who and what is aware of it)
