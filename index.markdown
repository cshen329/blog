I'm a transportation economist with five years of research experience investigating environmental issues in the transportation sector.

My research focuses foremost on estimating consumers' vehicle and travel demand, as well as evaluating policies and market incentives in promoting greener transportation and reducing GHG emissions. 

I hold a Ph.D. degree in Agricultural and Resource Economics (AREC) from University of Maryland.
