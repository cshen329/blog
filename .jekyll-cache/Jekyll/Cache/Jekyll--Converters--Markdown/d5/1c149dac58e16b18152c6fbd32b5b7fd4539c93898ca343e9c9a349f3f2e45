<p>A great Ted talk by Josh Kaufman.</p>

<p>Only takes 15 minutes to watch if speed it up to 1.5x.</p>

<p>In the TED talk, Josh Kaufman talked about how the 10K hours rule is a social media lie and you can get reasonably good at a skill by 20 hours and how to do it.</p>

<p>It really speaks to a perfectionist like me, who procrastinate on learning new skills because I habitually set too high standards for myself and learning new things becomes scary.</p>

<p><strong>My notes:</strong></p>

<p><strong>10K-hour rule VS 20-hour rule</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“10K hours to be at the top of the field in a highly competitive field” (original study on athletes)–evolved to – “10K hours to be an expert” –evolved to – “10K hours rule to learn something”. Suddenly the 10K rule is everywhere and demonized by social media.</li>
  <li>His research suggests it only took 20 hours to be reasonably good at a new skill.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here are the steps:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Deconstruct the skill
    <ul>
      <li>Break down skills into smaller pieces. Find the most essential sub-skills.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learn enough to self-correct
    <ul>
      <li>Get 3-5 study resources, just 3-5, don’t procrastinate in piling up study resources, just get started.</li>
      <li>Just learn enough to know if you are doing something wrong.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Remove practice barriers
    <ul>
      <li>The major barrier to skill acquisition isn’t intellectual, it’s emotional.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Practice at least 20hours</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example: Learn to play Ukulele</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the instrument</li>
  <li>Find the most common cords</li>
  <li>Most songs just use those 4-5 cords</li>
  <li>Practice 20 hours.</li>
  <li>And you can play most of the pop songs in the past 50 years.</li>
</ul>
